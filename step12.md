# 12. What’s next?

This concludes this simple getting started codelab with Kubernetes. We’ve only scratched the surface of this technology 
and we encourage you to explore further with your own pods, replication controllers, and services but also to check out 
liveness probes (health checks) and consider using the Kubernetes API directly.

Here are some follow-up steps:

- Remember, [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) is an open source project hosted on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). Your feedback and contributions are welcome.
- You can follow the Kubernetes news on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubernetesio) and on the community’s [blog](http://blog.kubernetes.io/).
- Go through the more advanced [“Compute Engine & Kubernetes” codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/compute-kubernetes/) from 
[Google Developers Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com).
- Try out other Google Cloud Platform features for yourself. Have a look at our [tutorials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/tutorials).
